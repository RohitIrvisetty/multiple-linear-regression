# multiple-linear-regression

In this notebook, used scikit-learn to implement Multiple linear regression. I downloaded a dataset that is related to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. Then, I split My data into training and test sets, create a model using training set, Evaluate model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown value
